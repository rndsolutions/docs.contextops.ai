### ContextOps.AI Overview

ContextOps.AI builds upon Open WebUI to provide a refined and fully managed experience with the following key capabilities:

### Multi-Model Support

- Users can seamlessly interact with a wide range of large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Mistral, LLaMA, Claude, and others via supported backends.
- Switching between models is straightforward and does not require technical setup.

### Multi-Modal Interface

- Beyond text, ContextOps.AI supports image inputs, enabling visual question answering and document understanding (where supported by the selected model).

### Multi-User & Role-Based Access

- Workspaces support multiple users with role-based permissions, allowing teams to collaborate securely.
- Administrators can manage access, assign roles, and oversee workspace activity.

### Agent Customization

- Agents can be configured with personalized behavior through system prompts, tool integrations, and retrieval settings.
- This allows users to design tailored assistants for specific use cases such as legal research, coding help, or knowledge discovery.

### Memory and Chat History

- ContextOps.AI maintains a structured memory for each agent, allowing users to resume previous conversations or review prior interactions.
- Chat history is searchable and categorized per workspace or project.

### Document Upload and RAG Integration

- Users can upload documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) and integrate them directly into agents via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Uploaded content is automatically indexed and used by the system to enhance response accuracy and contextual depth.

### Additional Features

- **Agent Workflows**: Build and customize AI workflows.
- **Tool Integrations**: Integrate external APIs and functions.
- **RAG Pipeline Support**: Attach your own datasets and indexes.
- **Vector Search**: Plug in your vector DB and embeddings.
- **Multi-role Access**: Support for end users, developers, and admins.
